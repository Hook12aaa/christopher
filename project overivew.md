# Constructivist Mathematics Implementation: Initial Architecture

## Project Overview

This implementation will translate the Field Theory of Social Constructs from theoretical framework to practical application. The system will model how conceptual charges interact within semantic fields, enabling the analysis of resonance patterns between artists and venues.

## Embedding Space Selection and Implementation
The foundation of our Constructivist Mathematics implementation rests on a hyperbolic neural manifold implemented through Poincaré ball embeddings, which naturally aligns with our delta manifold's non-Euclidean geometry. This approach leverages the BGE-Large-v1.5 model's rich semantic understanding as our initial universe, projecting these embeddings into hyperbolic space where we can implement our conceptual charge dynamics. 

The hyperbolic architecture offers superior representation of hierarchical relationships with exponential capacity growth (38% lower distortion than Euclidean alternatives) while enabling the Möbius-like topological structures essential for modeling self-reinforcing narratives. We'll implement a mixed-curvature product space (combining hyperbolic and spherical geometries) with learnable curvature parameters, optimized through MLX for Apple Silicon, allowing us to represent different aspects of social relationships through appropriate geometric principles.

## Core Workflow: Artist-Venue Matching

1. **Input Processing**:
   - Data Crwaling for Artists insight (Social Meida, Wiki, Homepage) → Artist conceptual charges
   - Venue descriptions, past events, audience info → Venue field configuration
   - Pre- Trained Model for addational Semantic feild configureation

2. **Field Interaction**:
   - Artist conceptual charges are introduced into the venue's field
   - Field dynamics calculations simulate how charges propagate
   - Feild dymanics calucation resonance between audinece constructs found in feild by Artists

3. **Stability Analysis**:
   - System assesses whether artist charges stabilize or dissipate within venue field
   - Constructive interference indicates potential successful performance
   - Destructive interference indicates poor venue fit

4. **Recommendation Generation**:
   - High stability venues are recommended
   - Alternative venues with similar field properties may be suggested
   - Potential audience resonance patterns are identified

## Technology Stack Considerations

- **Python Core**: Primary implementation language
- **MLX**: For efficient tensor operations on Apple Silicon
- **FastAPI**: For REST API implementation
- **Sentence Transformers**: For accessing rich embedding spaces
- ** PyVista + Plotly*** For Vislusation both complex and simple
- **PostgreSQL with pgvector**: Storing only low
- **In-Memory Processing** For the most mathematically intensive operations
- **Docker**: For containerization and deployment


The modular design allows for focused development starting with the embedding engine, then adding field dynamics, before finally implementing the resonance analysis and visualization components.
