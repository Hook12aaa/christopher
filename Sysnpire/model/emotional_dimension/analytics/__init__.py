Emotional Analytics - Field-Theoretic Pattern Discovery

This module discovers intrinsic emotional patterns in BGE embeddings through
geometric, spectral, and topological analysis. NO categorical emotion labels.
NO ontological references. Only mathematical patterns that emerge naturally
from the embedding space itself.

Key Insight: Emotion is not classification but field modulation - geometric 
distortions in semantic space that guide meaning propagation.
