Emotional Dimension - Field Modulation (Section 3.1.3)

Reconceptualizes emotion as field-modulating forces that transform semantic landscapes
through amplitude modulation, phase shifts, and metric warping.

Components:
- field_modulation.py: ℰ(τ) emotional modulation tensor operations
- attention_deconstruction.py: Geometric analysis of attention mechanisms
- resonance_patterns.py: Emotional interference and resonance effects
