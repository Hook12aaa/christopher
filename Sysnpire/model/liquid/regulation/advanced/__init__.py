Advanced Regulation Systems

Optional advanced mathematical frameworks for field regulation:
- Variational optimization (JAX)
- Geometric field analysis (geomstats) 
- Coupled field evolution (SciPy PDEs)
- Symbolic mathematics (SymPy)

These systems enhance the core regulation capabilities with sophisticated
mathematical approaches while maintaining graceful fallbacks.
