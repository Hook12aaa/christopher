Temporal Dimension

UNIFIED FIELD-MOVEMENT ARCHITECTURE: Implements temporal dimensions as breathing
patterns that modulate conceptual charge formation. Following the weather map analogy,
temporal trajectories and field effects are unified entities that interfere with each other.

MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION: Section 3.1.4 - Temporal Dimension
- Trajectory operators T_i(τ,C,s) = ∫₀ˢ ω_i(τ,s')·e^(iφ_i(τ,s')) ds'
- Observational persistence Ψ_persistence(s-s₀) with dual-decay structure
- Field-movement unity where breathing IS the field generation process

BGE TEMPORAL EXTRACTION: Leverages natural temporal signatures from BGE's
heat kernel field evolution, spatial spectral analysis, and trajectory persistence.
