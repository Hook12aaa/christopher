"""
Charge Factory - Focused Q(Ï„, C, s) Transformation Engine

FOCUSED RESPONSIBILITY: This factory has ONE job - take embedding vectors with their
mathematical properties and transform them into dynamic conceptual charges using the
complete Q(Ï„, C, s) field theory formula. It does NOT handle data sourcing.

MATHEMATICAL TRANSFORMATION:
Input: Static embedding + model_geometric + field 
Process: Apply complete Q(Ï„, C, s) = Î³ Â· T(Ï„, C, s) Â· E^trajectory(Ï„, s) Â· Î¦^semantic(Ï„, s) Â· e^(iÎ¸_total(Ï„,C,s)) Â· Î¨_persistence(s-sâ‚€)
Output: Uploads our dynamic conceptual charge to a live universe, ready for interaction.

DESIGN PRINCIPLE: This factory is model-agnostic and source-agnostic. It can process
embeddings from BGE models, MPNet models, scraped data, user inputs, or any other
source that provides embedding vectors + mathematical properties.

If it is starting from a base model, from base must be set to True. This is usually the BGE or MPNet model.

USAGE CONTEXTS:
- Initial "Big Bang" from model vocabularies (separate script)
- For building the universe from base model use .build()
- For Rejection/Accepting a new data scrapt content, use .integrate()
