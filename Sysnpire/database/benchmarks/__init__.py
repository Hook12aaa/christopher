Benchmarks - Performance Verification

Performance testing and complexity verification for the field database.
Ensures O(log n), O(n), O(k) targets are met.

Components:
- write_performance: Charge â†’ Lance write speed benchmarks
- query_latency: <100ms response time verification
- tensor_benchmarks: Native tensor operation performance tests
