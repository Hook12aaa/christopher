"""
Lance Storage - Direct Tensor Storage (The Vinyl)

Native tensor storage using Lance+Arrow without serialization overhead.
Stores field patterns as tensor data for efficient access and computation.

Components:
- field_store: ConceptualChargeObject â†’ Lance tensor storage
- arrow_schema: Arrow schemas for field data structures
- tensor_operations: Native tensor operations on stored data
- batch_writer: Efficient batch writing to Lance datasets
