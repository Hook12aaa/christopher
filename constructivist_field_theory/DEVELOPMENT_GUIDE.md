# Development Guide: Building the Field Theory Framework

This guide provides a practical roadmap for implementing the complete Field Theory of Social Constructs framework.

## Current Status

✅ **Foundation Ready**
- Complete mathematical documentation and theory
- Project structure with proper module organization
- Core mathematical components documented
- Product manifold framework outlined

🚧 **Next Development Steps**
- Basic implementations need to be built and tested
- Import dependencies need to be resolved
- Working examples need to be created
- Test suite needs to be implemented

## Development Priority Order

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Start Here)
**Goal**: Get basic conceptual charges working

1. **Fix Core Mathematics**
   ```bash
   # Test basic charge creation
   cd core_mathematics/
   python -c "from conceptual_charge import ConceptualCharge; print('Core math imports OK')"
   ```

2. **Basic Embedding Engine**
   ```bash
   # Test BGE model loading
   cd embedding_engine/
   python -c "from models import ConceptualChargeGenerator; print('Embedding engine OK')"
   ```

3. **Simple Working Example**
   ```python
   # This should work after Phase 1
   from embedding_engine.models import ConceptualChargeGenerator
   
   generator = ConceptualChargeGenerator()
   charge = generator.create_conceptual_charge("test text")
   Q = charge.compute_complete_charge()
   print(f"Charge: {Q}")
   ```

### Phase 2: Product Manifold Basics
**Goal**: Simple manifold creation and visualization

4. **Transformation Operator**
   - Fix imports in `product_manifold/transformation_operator.py`
   - Create simple test for charge → imprint conversion
   - Basic spatial profiling implementation

5. **Manifold Field Equation**
   - Basic field evolution with simple initial conditions
   - Numerical integration working
   - Memory management for spatial grids

6. **Simple Manifold Assembly**
   ```python
   # Goal for Phase 2
   from product_manifold.product_manifold import ProductManifold
   
   manifold = ProductManifold()
   manifold.add_conceptual_charges([charge1, charge2])
   manifold.evolve_manifold(1.0)
   sociology_map = manifold.create_sociology_map()
   ```

### Phase 3: Data Pipeline and Scaling
**Goal**: Batch processing and real applications

7. **Pipeline Implementation**
   - Fix imports in data pipeline
   - Basic batch processing
   - Simple text → manifold workflow

8. **Visualization**
   - Basic plotting of manifold fields
   - Charge position visualization
   - Simple sociology map display

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
**Goal**: Research-ready platform

9. **API Integration**
10. **Advanced Analysis Tools**
11. **Performance Optimization**
12. **Research Applications**

## Immediate Development Tasks

### Task 1: Fix Import Structure
Current issues to resolve:

```python
# These imports need to work:
from core_mathematics.conceptual_charge import ConceptualCharge
from embedding_engine.models import ConceptualChargeGenerator  
from product_manifold.product_manifold import ProductManifold
```

### Task 2: Create Minimal Working Example
Create `examples/minimal_example.py`:

```python
"""
Minimal working example demonstrating core functionality.
This should be the first thing that works.
"""

def test_basic_charge():
    """Test creating and computing a conceptual charge"""
    # Add actual implementation
    pass

def test_simple_manifold():
    """Test creating a simple manifold with one charge"""
    # Add actual implementation  
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_basic_charge()
    test_simple_manifold()
    print("✅ Minimal example working!")
```

### Task 3: Dependency Management
Update `requirements.txt` with actual needed packages:

```txt
# Core scientific computing
numpy>=1.21.0
scipy>=1.7.0

# Machine learning and embeddings  
sentence-transformers>=2.2.0
torch>=1.11.0

# Data processing
pandas>=1.3.0

# Visualization
matplotlib>=3.5.0

# API framework
quart>=0.18.0

# Optional: Advanced features
scikit-learn>=1.1.0  # For semantic clustering
psutil>=5.8.0        # For memory monitoring
```

### Task 4: Create Development Tests
Create `tests/test_development.py`:

```python
"""
Development tests to verify each component as it's built.
Run these frequently during development.
"""

import pytest
import numpy as np

def test_imports():
    """Test that all modules can be imported"""
    try:
        from core_mathematics.conceptual_charge import ConceptualCharge
        from embedding_engine.models import ConceptualChargeGenerator
        assert True, "Basic imports working"
    except ImportError as e:
        pytest.fail(f"Import failed: {e}")

def test_basic_charge_creation():
    """Test basic charge creation without errors"""
    # Implement when ConceptualCharge is working
    pass

def test_simple_computation():
    """Test basic mathematical computation"""
    # Test that scipy and numpy operations work
    result = np.exp(1j * np.pi) + 1
    assert np.abs(result) < 1e-10, "Complex math working"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pytest.main([__file__])
```

## Development Workflow

### Daily Development Cycle
1. **Run Tests**: `python tests/test_development.py`
2. **Work on Current Phase**: Focus on one component at a time
3. **Test Changes**: Run minimal example after each change
4. **Document Progress**: Update this guide with what works
5. **Commit Working Code**: Only commit when tests pass

### Debugging Strategy
1. **Start Small**: Get the simplest possible thing working first
2. **Fix Imports**: Resolve import errors before functionality
3. **Mock Complex Parts**: Use simple placeholders initially
4. **Add Complexity Gradually**: One mathematical component at a time

### Code Organization Principles
1. **Fail Fast**: Add assertions and error checking early
2. **Document Assumptions**: Comment what each function expects
3. **Test Incrementally**: Write tests as you build components
4. **Keep Examples Updated**: Ensure examples stay working

## Current Working Components

### ✅ Working (Ready to Build On)
- Project structure and documentation
- Mathematical formulations and theory
- Module organization and documentation

### 🚧 In Progress (Needs Implementation)
- Core mathematical operations
- BGE model integration
- Basic manifold operations

### ❌ Not Started (Future Work)
- Advanced visualization
- API endpoints
- Batch processing optimization
- Research applications

## Getting Started Commands

```bash
# 1. Set up development environment
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Test basic imports (should work first)
python -c "import numpy, scipy; print('Scientific computing OK')"

# 3. Test BGE model download (may take time)
python -c "from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer; SentenceTransformer('BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5')"

# 4. Run development tests
python tests/test_development.py

# 5. Work on minimal example
python examples/minimal_example.py
```

## Next Session Goals

1. **Get Core Imports Working**: Fix import paths and dependencies
2. **Create Minimal Charge**: Basic ConceptualCharge that computes something
3. **Simple BGE Integration**: Load model and create embeddings
4. **Basic Test Suite**: Automated tests to verify progress
5. **Working Example**: End-to-end example that demonstrates core concept

Focus on getting something simple working rather than implementing everything. The mathematical framework is solid - now we need buildable, testable code that demonstrates the concepts.
