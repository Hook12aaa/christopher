Data Pipeline Module

Orchestrates the complete data flow from conceptual charges to manifold assembly.

This module provides:
- Charge collection and preprocessing pipelines
- Batch manifold assembly from charge sets
- Real-time manifold updates and evolution
- Data export and visualization preparation
- Performance optimization for large-scale processing

Key pipeline stages:
1. Charge Collection: Text → Conceptual Charges
2. Manifold Assembly: Charges → Product Manifold  
3. Evolution Processing: Dynamic manifold evolution
4. Analysis Pipeline: Collective phenomena extraction
5. Visualization Export: Sociology map generation
