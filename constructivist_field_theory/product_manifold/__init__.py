Product Manifold Module

Implements Section 3.2 - The Product Manifold where conceptual charges collectively operate.

This module provides:
- Product manifold M as geometric space for charge interactions
- Transformation operator T[Q] for charge-to-imprint conversion  
- Manifold field equation ∂M/∂t = ∇²M + F[M] + Σᵢ T[Qᵢ]
- Collective response function R_collective = M · G[M] · M†
- Dynamic visualization of "living sociology map"

Key mathematical components:
- Non-Euclidean geometric space creation
- Field evolution through charge interactions  
- Emergent collective phenomena detection
- Real-time manifold dynamics and visualization
