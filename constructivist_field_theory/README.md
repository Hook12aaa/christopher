# Constructivist Mathematics Implementation

## Overview

This project implements the Field Theory of Social Constructs, translating theoretical frameworks into practical applications. The system models how conceptual charges interact within semantic fields, enabling analysis of resonance patterns between artists and venues.

## Core Concept

The foundation of this implementation rests on a hyperbolic neural manifold implemented through Poincar√© ball embeddings, which naturally aligns with our delta manifold's non-Euclidean geometry. This approach leverages rich semantic embeddings as our initial universe, projecting them into hyperbolic space where we can implement conceptual charge dynamics.

## Project Components

The system consists of six main components:

1. **Embedding Space Engine**: Provides the foundation for conceptual charges through semantic embedding
2. **Conceptual Charge Generator**: Transforms embeddings into multidimensional charges
3. **Field Dynamics Engine**: Models how charges interact to form the delta manifold field
4. **Resonance Analysis System**: Analyzes how different entities interact within the field
5. **Visualization Engine**: Creates visual representations of field dynamics
6. **REST API Layer**: Provides programmatic access to system capabilities

## Core Workflow: Artist-Venue Matching

1. **Input Processing**: Transform artist and venue data into conceptual charges and field configurations
2. **Field Interaction**: Model how artist charges propagate through venue fields
3. **Stability Analysis**: Assess compatibility through interference patterns
4. **Recommendation Generation**: Identify high-stability matches and alternatives
